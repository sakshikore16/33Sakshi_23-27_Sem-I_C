# C Programs Repository üñ•Ô∏èüöÄ 

Welcome to my C programs repository! Below are the programs available in this repository, which mark the beginning of my coding journey. These programs are simple yet fundamental, serving as the foundation of my exploration into the world of programming.

## Programs

1. [First Prog](firstprog.c) - A basic C program demonstrating the structure of a C program.
2. [Name Print](my_name.c) - A simple program to print your name.
3. [Addition](addition.c) - A program to add two numbers.
4. [Factorial](factorial.c) - Calculate the factorial of a given number.
5. [Simple Interest](si_calculations.c) - Calculate simple interest based on user input.
6. [Swapping](swapping_values.c) - Swap two variables without using a temporary variable.
7. [Tic Tac Toe](tictactoe.c) - Implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe.
